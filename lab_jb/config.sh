#### VALUES YOU NEED TO CHANGE ################################################

# You should update the values in this section according to their comments to
# be appropriate for your project.

# The "program memory" should be whatever you named the SystemVerilog array
# where you assembled program gets loaded. You can use any sub-string of the
# fully qualified name of your array's name, starting on the right. For
# example, if your program memory was 'simtop.cpu0.program_rom', you could just
# specify 'program_rom', unless you had more than one array named
# 'program_rom'.
#
# You need to set this or the simulator will not know where to load data into
# your processor.
PROGRAM_MEMORY="program_rom"

# NOTE: we aren't using the data memory in Fall 2020, you can just ignore this
# one.
#
# This works similarly to the PROGRAM_MEMORY variable, but for your data
# memory. The simulator needs to know this so it can properly initialize
# the data memory on reset.
DATA_MEMORY="data_mem"

# Similarly to PROGRAM_MEMORY, but specifies the array which stores your
# register file. This is needed so the simulator can show you the contents of
# your register file.
REGISTER_MEMORY="regfile0.mem"

# This should be your USC network ID. If your university email address is
# jsmith@email.sc.edu, you should set this to "jsmith".
